# Compatibility ABIs for UniversalProfile

This folder contains historical ABIs from previous release versions.

This is to enable dApps and projects to be backward compatible in their interfaces to display and interact with UnviersalProfile token contracts deployed with these old versions, by consuming their old ABIs.
